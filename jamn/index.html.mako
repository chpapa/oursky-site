			<p class="paragraph">Being a younger sibling of the award-winning Jamn MULTI-TOOL, it targets to become the best music player for musicians. The app is beautifully designed to make playing the songs you love super easy. It's a game changer that brings more fun to discover and play music.

			<p class="paragraph">Johnny Quattro, the CEO of Jamn, advances the adventure further with us after the success of MULTI-TOOL. He noticed that musicians often struggle with searching for the right chords for a song. We then worked with him and his team to plan, design and prove the idea iteratively, turning the problem into a delightful simple solution - PLAYER.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">We are thrilled when Jamn PLAYER was featured globally by App Store on its first launch, and has been inspiring more than 700,000 music lovers in the past 6 months.
